"""GPU prefetch wrapper for PyTorch DataLoaders.

Overlaps host-to-device transfers with GPU compute by using a
dedicated CUDA stream.  Batches arrive on-device; the training
loop no longer needs explicit ``.to(device)`` calls.

Usage
-----
>>> loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4)
>>> prefetched = GPUPrefetcher(loader, device="cuda:0")
>>> for inputs, targets in prefetched:
...     # inputs and targets are already on GPU
...     pred = model(inputs)
